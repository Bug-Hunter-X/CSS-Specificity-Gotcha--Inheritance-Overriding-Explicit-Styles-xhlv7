The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and using more specific selectors to target the paragraph within the div.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

/* Solution: Use a more specific selector */
div p {
  color: green;
}

/*Alternative solution(use with caution) : using !important */
div p {
  color: green !important;
}
```
By using `div p`, we ensure that the paragraph styling within the div takes precedence.
