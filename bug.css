The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance.  The intention is to style the paragraph within the div with a specific color, but due to the way specificity works, the paragraph inherits the div's color, overriding the explicit paragraph styling. 

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red; 
}

.specific-div p {
  color: green;
}
```
